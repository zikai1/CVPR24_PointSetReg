# CVPR24_PointSetReg
This repository contains the official implementation of our CVPR 2024 highlight paper "Correspondence-Free Nonrigid Point Set Registration Using Unsupervised Clustering Analysis". 

For convenience, the repository provides both MATLAB and C++ implementations. 

## MATLAB 
- Download the directory "matlab_code".
- Start MATLAB and run "test_demo.m".
  
  This will give you an immediate registration result for the test point cloud data in the directory "data". 

  


## C++

Please note that the code is still under maintenance.
