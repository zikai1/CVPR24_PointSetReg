# CVPR24_PointSetReg (Highlight)
This repository contains the official implementation of our CVPR 2024 paper "Correspondence-Free Nonrigid Point Set Registration Using Unsupervised Clustering Analysis". 

- For convenience, the repository provides both **MATLAB** and **C++** implementations. 
- The MATLAB implementation is extremely **simple**, while C++ implementation is much **faster**. 

## MATLAB 
- Step 1: Download the directory **"matlab_code"**, which contains data normalization, registration, and denormalization implementations. 
- Step 2: Start MATLAB and run **"test_demo.m"**. This will give you an immediate registration result for the test point cloud data in the directory **"data"**. 

  


## C++
We are re-implementing the MATLAB code using C++ for better efficiency. We will release it as soon as possible!
